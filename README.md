Test task notes:

- State: for this task will be better to use a store library like Redux, Mobx, .etc. Or to set up a context provider to share state between
  components because the current approach with hooks is not extensible but I decided to start with it just to focus on the game logic instead
  of setup the project infrastructure

- Styles: Will be better to use CSS-in-js library or CSS modules to avoid global styles conflicts but in scope of this task we can use a simple CSS approach
